Cordova Plugin for OpenTok iOS
===

Weave video chat into your web (and now mobile!) application.

## Using Cordova CLI
**Make sure You have Cordova 3.3 Installed** If you haven't, view [Cordova instructions](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.3.0/guide_cli_index.md.html) Page.  
Clone this repo to get the source code for OpenTok's Cordova plugin

1. Create a Cordova app by typing into Terminal:  
`cordova create my-app`  

2. Install OpenTok plugin into your app:
`cd my-app`  
`cordova plugin add path/to/Opentok's/CordovaPlugin/that/you/cloned`  
> Plugin already exists? To remove OpenTokPlugin: `cordova plugin remove com.tokbox.opentok.cordova.OpenTokPlugin`

3a. For **Android Apps**, add Android platform into your cordova app
`cordova platform add android`

3b. For **iOS Apps**, add iOS platform into your cordova app
`cordova platform add ios`

4. Edit your code in the created `www` folder

5. To deploy your app to your android device:
`cordova run android --device`

6. To deploy your app to your iOS device:  
> As of 1/17/2014, you cannot deploy to device with Cordova CLI for iOS apps. You need to first prepare you iOS app: `cordova prepare iOS`  
> Next, open the project in xcode and run it on device: `open platforms/ios/HelloWorld.xcodeproj`

## Getting Started on your Project:
All your editing will be done in your www folder.

To use the opentok library, make sure you include **opentok.js** file in your HTML document.  
` <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="opentok.js"></script>`

All JavaScript code should be written in `deviceready` function in */js/index.js* because it is executed after all dependencies has loaded.

    deviceready: function() {
        // Do Your Stuff Here!
        app.report('deviceready');
    },

To view and interact with elements on the browser console, use [weinre](http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/docs/latest/). Here's a few things to take note of if you are using weinre on a local network:
* make sure all devices are connected to the same network
* make sure you bind weinre to 0.0.0.0 so your mobile devices: `weinre --boundHost 0.0.0.0`
* when you include the js library from weinre, make sure to use your computer's ip address and not localhost!
